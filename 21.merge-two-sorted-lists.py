#
# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should
# be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not l1 or not l2:
            return l1 or l2
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
            return l1
        else:
            l2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next)
            return l2
